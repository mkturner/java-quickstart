# Java Quickstart Repo

## Intro
I am using this repo to keep track of my code as I learn Java as part of a course on Android Development. 
It will probably be very basic. The point is to show rudimentary knowledge of writing & compiling Java programs with Eclipse.

## Where to look.
All source code will be located in the 'src' folder, which is found in the LearnJava project Directory.
