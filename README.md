# Java Quickstart Repo

## Intro
I am using this repo to keep track of my code as I 
learn Java as part of a course on Android Development. 
It will probably be very basic. The point is to show 
rudimentary knowledge of writing & compiling Java 
programs with Eclipse.

## Goals
The repository has these goals:
- demonstrate familiarity with writing Java source code
- demonstrate familiarity with using Eclipse to manage Java projects 
- demonstrate familiarity with using the [eGit](http://eclipse.org/egit/) plug-in within Eclipse 

## Where to look.
All source code will be located in the 'src' folder, 
which is found in the LearnJava project Directory.
